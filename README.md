# coolinator3000 
The project is a top hat that consists of a servo mounted fan and LEDs. We came up with the project idea organically while brainstorming as a team--someone mentioned the idea of a hat and then another person suggested putting a propeller on it and we just thought of the most wacky hat possible.Parts used: ELEGOO kit (mostly for sensors: IR remote and receiver, temperature sensor, and also the fan itself and power supply), arduino nano as the microcontroller, a MOSFET to control the motor, a microphone and two 2n2222 BJTs for the noise sensor, solderless breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs. So its also contains some of the cooling system. you can control the fan by the remote
